* Create a new folder in `~/Code/` with your project name and checkout a Shopware installation or use `swdc create-project [Folder Name]`
   * The installation folder can be:
      * https://github.com/shopware/platform
      * https://github.com/shopware/production (Same as the download zip)
      * https://github.com/shopware/development
      * https://github.com/shopware/shopware (Same as the download zip)
      * https://github.com/shopware/composer-project
* Run `swdc build [Folder Name]`
* After the installation succeeds, can you open the shop with the command `swdc open [Folder Name]` or `[Folder Name].dev.localhost`
